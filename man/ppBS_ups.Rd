\title{Pseudo-population bootstrap for simple random sampling}
\usage{
ppBS_ups(y, pik, B, D = 1, method, design, x = NULL, s = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{vector of sample values}

\item{B}{scalar, number of bootstrap replications}

\item{D}{scalar, number of replications for the double bootstrap}

\item{method}{a string indicating the bootstrap method to be used, available
methods are: 'Gross', 'Booth', 'ChaoLo85', 'ChaoLo94', 'BickelFreedman', 'Sitter'}

\item{design}{sampling procedure to be used for sample selection.
Either a string indicating the name of the sampling design or a function;
see section "Details" for more information.}

\item{x}{vector of length N with values of the auxiliary variable for all population units,
only required if method "HotDeck" is chosen}

\item{s}{logical vector of length N, TRUE for units in the sample, FALSE otherwise. 
Alternatively, a vector of length n with the indices of the sample units.
Only required for "HotDeck" method.}
}
\description{
Pseudo-population bootstrap for simple random sampling
}
\details{
Argument \code{design} accepts either a string indicating the sampling design
to use to draw samples or a function.
Accepted designs are "brewer", "tille", "maxEntropy", "poisson",
"sampford", "systematic", "randomSystematic".
The user may also pass a function as argument; such function should take as input
a vector of length N of inclusion probabilities and return a vector of length N,
either logical or a vector of 0s and 1s,  where \code{TRUE} or \code{1} indicate sampled
units and \code{FALSE} or \code{0} indicate non-sample units.
