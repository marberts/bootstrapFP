\title{Bootstrap algorithms for Finite Population sampling}
\usage{
bootstrapFP(y, pik, B, D = 1, method, design, x = NULL, s = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{vector of sample values}

\item{pik}{vector of sample first-order inclusion probabilities}

\item{B}{scalar, number of bootstrap replications}

\item{D}{scalar, number of replications for the double bootstrap (when applicable)}

\item{method}{a string indicating the bootstrap method to be used, see Details for more}

\item{design}{sampling procedure to be used for sample selection.
Either a string indicating the name of the sampling design or a function;
see section "Details" for more information.}

\item{x}{vector of length N with values of the auxiliary variable for all population units,
only required if method "ppHotDeck" is chosen}

\item{s}{logical vector of length N, TRUE for units in the sample, FALSE otherwise. 
Alternatively, a vector of length n with the indices of the sample units.
Only required for "ppHotDeck" method.}
}
\value{
The bootstrap variance of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator.
}
\description{
Bootstrap variance estimation for finite population sampling.

\details{
Argument \code{design} accepts either a string indicating the sampling design
to use to draw samples or a function.
Accepted designs are "brewer", "tille", "maxEntropy", "poisson",
"sampford", "systematic", "randomSystematic", "srs", chao", "sunter", "srs", "fpdust", "fpdust_pps".
The user may also pass a function as argument; such function should take as input
the parameters passed to argument \code{design_pars} and return either a logical
vector or a vector of 0 and 1,  where \code{TRUE} or \code{1} indicate sampled
units and \code{FALSE} or \code{0} indicate non-sample units.
The length of such vector must be equal to the length of \code{x}
if \code{units} is not specified, otherwise it must have the same length of \code{units}.


\code{method} must be a string indicating the bootstrap method to use.
A list of the currently available methods follows, the sampling design they
they should be used with is indicated in square brackets.
The prefix "pp" indicates a pseudo-population method, the prefix "d"
represents a direct method, and the prefix "w" inicates a weights method.
For more details on these methods see Mashreghi et al. (2016).
